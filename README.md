# Blog-Site

Educating yourself and learning new subjects crucial at any stage in anyone's life. It's especially helpful during college where we're thrown information from a plethora of subjects (7 for me presently).

With this project, I want to create a blog site where I record information that I've found everyday. I've been adamant on recording new information that interests me and making sure I look further into the topic, so recording it will be another step that helps me solidify the information I come across. 

My main reason for doing this is because information (despite what we may believe) is crucial, regardless of your intended occupation or focus of study. Just because you may not be pursuing a career an English Writer or a Judge, remembering specific information that's derived from those expertises can substantially benefit you in the long run.
Not only can the information benefit you, but every subject and topic that we learn has a key theme surrounding it. Everyone may not be cognizant of the theme that encompasses the topic, but that does not mean it is inexistent. Therefore, by analyzing the key points and characteristics of the topics and information we review, we can enhance our ability to discover these implicit details that may require some further investigation.

While this project is not entirely focused on my Software Engineering pathway, this is a project that's essential to me. Instead of sharpening my skills in one department, I will be throwing everything but the kitchen sink in a way. 
I have so many interests in life (too many to be fair) that I constantly give spotlight to periodically, and I believe there is a need to better incorporate that information into a holistic project. 

Why limit myself? Why can't I learn code, learn the justice system, improve my writing, educate myself on race, and etc all within one journal? 
When I record these kinds of information on paper, I always tend to scatter and segregate that information rather than attempting to connect it and keep it in an organized, legible repository. That's really not the best way to go about learning, at least to me. 

In sum, I have a diverse amount of interests in life that I cannot conceal, such as:
- Technology & Programming
- Professional, Technical, and Critical Writing
- Design 
- Human Interaction and Experiences 
- Race 
- Crime and The Criminal Justice System
- Gaming
- Entertainment & Pop Culture 
- Baking & Cooking

With that being said, I feel that no one should feel the need to hide what it is they're passionate about in life, whether it be one thing or 20. Accumulating knowledge is one of the best priviliges we have in life, so why abandon or neglect that right? The more we educate ourselves, the more we can teach others and correct the errors that we & others may typically make in life. Life is a learning experience. If we abandon our will to learn and comprehend new information, we only disadvantage ourselves and compromise our own capabilities.
